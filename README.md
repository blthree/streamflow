A twitter bot that tweets the current flow rate of the Olentangy River in Columbus OH

As an avid fisherman, I spend a lot of time checking the water levels near my regular wading spot.
I decided to create this bot to tweet the river levels for me so I don't have to check the USGS water data site myself.
Suprisingly, the USGS has an amazing REST API for accessing this data, including a query builder that will assemble 
the correct URL endpoint for the data and formatting you need.

The query builder is available at: https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Test-Tool.html
